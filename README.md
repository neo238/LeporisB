# LeporisB

Leporis B is a relatively basic 2D Godot game developed by me and my friend, who creates the textures for the game. The objective of the game is kind of like a mix of exploration and puzzle, where the player has to progress through the game's levels and find the "checkpoint" to continue to the next level. As the game progresses the maps get larger and more complex, so the player has to explore more or even avoid obstacles that can reset the player's progress. Some advanced levels will contain some sort of hidden messages that hint to the game's lore that the player can piece together to get the backstory of Leporis B. Eventually the player can reach a good or a bad ending depending on the paths they choose.

The game's code is pretty mediocre as we are mostly just amateurs at Godot, but we do hope we can improve our skills as this game grows. Thanks for reading!
